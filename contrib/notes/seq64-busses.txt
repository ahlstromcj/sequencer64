Describes the sequence for creating input and output ports.

mastermidibus:

   while (next client)
   {
      while (next port)
      {
      }
   }

First client in ALSA is 0; it's 2 ports do not pass the client check.

Second client is 14.  The first port (unnumbered) has write (output)
capability.  The call is

   seq64::midibus::midibus
   (
      this=0x555555af9120,
      localclient=129,     // snd_seq_client_id()
      destclient=14,       // snd_seq_port_info_get_client()
      dest port=0,         // snd_seq_port_info_get_port()
      seq=0x555555b0ec90,
      port_name="Midi Through Port-0", // snd_seq_client_info_get_name()
      /* client name is unused, but why not? */
      id=0, queue=1, ppqn=-1
   )

   The client name is "Midi Through".

   The first port also has read (input) capability.  The midibus call
   is the same.

Third client is 128.  First port has write capability, but not read capability.
Four ports total.

   The client name is "TiMidity".
   The port name is "TiMidity port 0".

Fourth client is 129.  None of its 4 ports pass the client check.

We then create an announcement buss:

   seq64::midibus::midibus
   (
      this=0x555555b0fd90,
      localclient=129,
      destclient=0,
      destport=1,
      seq=0x555555b0ed10,
      c=0x555555794cd0 "system",
      port_name=0x55 5555794cd7 "announce",
      id=0, queue=1, ppqn=-1
   )

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
