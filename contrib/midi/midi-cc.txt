0 Bank Select Allows user to switch bank for patch selection. Program change
   used with Bank Select. MIDI can access 16,384 patches per MIDI channel.
1 Modulation Generally this CC controls a vibrato effect (pitch, loudness,
   brighness). What is modulated is based on the patch.
2 Breath Controller Often times associated with aftertouch messages. It was
   originally intended for use with a breath MIDI controller in which blowing
   harder produced higher MIDI control values. It can be used for modulation as
   well.
3 Undefined  
4 Foot Controller Often used with aftertouch messages. It can send a
   continuous stream of values based on how the pedal is used.
5 Portamento Time Controls portamento rate to slide between 2 notes played
   subsequently.
6 Data Entry Most Significant Bit(MSB) Controls Value for NRPN or RPN
   parameters.
7 Volume Control the volume of the channel
8 Balance Controls the left and right balance, generally for stereo patches.
   0 = hard left, 64 = center, 127 = hard right
9 Undefined  
10 Pan Controls the left and right balance, generally for mono patches.
   0 = hard left, 64 = center, 127 = hard right
11 Expression Expression is a percentage of volume (CC7).
12 Effect Controller 1 Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within
   the synth/workstation.
13 Effect Controller 2 Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within
   the synth/workstation.

32 – 63 Controller 0-31 Least Significant Bit (LSB)  
64 Damper Pedal / Sustain Pedal On/Off switch that controls sustain. (See also
   Sostenuto CC 66) 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
65 Portamento On/Off Switch On/Off switch
   0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
66 Sostenuto On/Off Switch On/Off switch – Like the Sustain controller (CC 64),
   However it only holds notes that were “On” when the pedal was pressed. People
   use it to “hold” chords” and play melodies over the held chord.
   0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
67 Soft Pedal On/Off Switch On/Off switch - Lowers the volume of notes played.
   0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
68 Legato FootSwitch On/Off switch - Turns Legato effect between 2 subsequent
   notes On or Off.
   0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
70 Sound Controller 1 Usually controls the way a sound is produced. Default =
   Sound Variation.
71 Sound Controller 2 Allows shaping the Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF).
   Default = Resonance - also (Timbre or Harmonics)
72 Sound Controller 3 Controls release time of the Voltage controlled
   Amplifier (VCA). Default = Release Time.
73 Sound Controller 4 Controls the “Attack’ of a sound. The attack is the
   amount of time it takes forthe sound to reach maximum amplitude.
74 Sound Controller 5 Controls VCFs cutoff frequency of the filter.
75 Sound Controller 6 Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave
   their sounds.
76 Sound Controller 7 Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave
   their sounds.
77 Sound Controller 8 Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave
   their sounds.
78 Sound Controller 9 Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave
   their sounds.
79 Sound Controller 10 Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave
   their sounds.
80 General Purpose On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
81 On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
82 General Purpose On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
83 On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
84 Portamento CC Control Controls the amount of Portamento.
85 – 90 Undefined  
91 Effect 1 Depth Usually controls reverb send amount
92 Effect 2 Depth Usually controls tremolo amount
93 Effect 3 Depth Usually controls chorus amount
94 Effect 4 Depth Usually controls detune amount
95 Effect 5 Depth Usually controls phaser amount
96 (+1) Data Increment Usually used to increment data for RPN and NRPN messages.
97 (-1) Data Decrement Usually used to decrement data for RPN and NRPN messages.
98 Non-Registered Parameter Number LSB (NRPN) For controllers 6, 38, 96, and
   97, it selects the NRPN parameter.
99 Non-Registered Parameter Number MSB (NRPN) For controllers 6, 38, 96, and
   97, it selects the NRPN parameter.
100 Registered Parameter Number LSB (RPN) For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97,
   it selects the RPN parameter.
101 Registered Parameter Number MSB (RPN) For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97,
   it selects the RPN parameter.
102 – 119 Undefined  
121 Reset All Controllers It will reset all controllers to their default.
122 Local On/Off Switch Turns internal connection of a MIDI
   keyboard/workstation, etc. On or Off. If you use a computer, you will most
   likely want local control off to avoid notes being played twice. Once
   locally and twice whent the note is sent back from the computer to your
   keyboard.
123 All Notes Off Mutes all sounding notes. Release time will still be
   maintained, and notes held by sustain will not turn off until sustain pedal
   is depressed.
124 Omni Mode Off Sets to “Omni Off” mode.
125 Omni Mode On Sets to “Omni On” mode.
126 Mono Mode Sets device mode to Monophonic.
127 Poly Mode Sets device mode to Polyphonic.
