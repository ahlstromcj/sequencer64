Notes on Yoshimi

2016-05-15 to 2016-05-15

This directory contains notes on setting up a sample sequence from scratch, and
the steps we followed.  Should be useful as an integration test.

First, let us explore the Will Godfrey (folderol, abrolag) collection and find
some good sounds and ideas for an original "composition".

Run "Yoshimi / Paths / Bank Root Dirs..." and then select the directory where
the Yoshimi banks are stored.  On our setup, we had previously added
/user/local/share/yoshimi/banks.  Then click the "Open current" button.
In the banks dialog that comes up, click on "Will Godfrey Collection".
Now we can explore the instruments in this bank.

   7. Ethereal: A good metallic step background in the low notes.
   8. Metal Drips:  A combination of synth, organ, and harpsichoard.  A
      sub-lead.
