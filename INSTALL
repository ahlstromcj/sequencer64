INSTALL for Sequencer64 v 0.9.9.0

The current packaging for Sequencer64 is primarily aimed at developers.
There is currently no configure script... it must be bootstrapped.

Steps:

   1.  Preload any DEPENDENCIES.  However, if some are missing, the
       configure script will tell you, or, at worst, a buld error will tell
       you.

   2. From the top project directory, run the commands:

      $ ./bootstrap
      $ ./configure

      For debugging without libtool getting in the way, just run:

      $ ./bootstrap --enable-debug

   3. Run the make command:

      $ make

      If you do not care about the documentation and debian packaging,
      change to the "src" directory for running make.

   4. To install, become root and run:

      # make install

DEPENDENCIES:

   With luck, the following dependencies will bring in their own
   dependencies when installed.

   Code:

      -  libgtkmm-2.4-dev (dev is the header-file package)
      -  libsigc++-2.0-dev
      -  libjack-jackd2-dev
      -  liblash-compat-dev (optional)

   Build tools:

      -  automake and autoconf
      -  autoconf-archive
      -  g++
      -  make
      -  libtool
      -  More?

   Documentation:

      -  doxygen and doxygen-latex
      -  graphviz
      -  texlive
      -  More?
      
   Debian packaging:

      -  debhelper
      -  fakeroot
      -  More?
