\page       user_testing_page User Testing of Sequencer64 with Yoshimi
\author     Chris Ahlstrom 2016-03-04

\section user_testing_intro Introduction

This section describes user testing of Sequencer64 using Yoshimi.
It will expand as we work our way through all the many use-cases
that can be achieved with Sequencer64 and Yoshimi.

Please note that the most advanced and recent testing can be found currently in
the document <code>contrib/notes/jack-testing.txt</code>.  We will eventually
merge the final tests here... someday.

\section user_testing_smoke Smoke Test

Every so often we run Sequencer64 with a software synthesizer to make sure we
haven't broken any functionality via our major refactoring efforts.  We call it
a "smoke test".  We fire up the two application, and see if anything smokes.

This smoke test sets up Yoshimi with a very simple ALSA setup, and no
instruments are loaded.  Instead, only the "Simple Sound" is used on all
channels.  We've been doing this test with Yoshimi 1.3.6.  The current Debian
Sid ("testing") version of Yoshimi is 1.3.6-2, pulled from SourceForge.  It
seems to have issues, so we've been cloning and pulling the code from:

\verbatim
   https://github.com/Yoshimi/yoshimi.git
\endverbatim

After getting the application build and installed, the next step is to run
it, using ALSA for MIDI and for audio:

\verbatim
   $ yoshimi -a -A &
\endverbatim

Next, fix up the configuration files for Sequencer64,
<code>~/.config/sequencer64/sequencer64.rc</code> and
<code>~/.config/sequencer64/sequencer64.usr</code>.

First hide <code>sequencer64.usr</code> somewhere, or delete it,
as it will determine what MIDI devices are available, and we don't want that
(yet).  Second, make sure that <code>sequencer64.rc</code> makes the following
setting:

\verbatim
   [manual-alsa-ports]

   # Set to 1 if you want sequencer64 to create its own ALSA ports and
   # not connect to other clients

   0   # number of manual ALSA ports
\endverbatim

Next, run the newly-built version of Sequencer64.  If desired, use the --bus
option described below to force the buss number to the buss you need, as shown
in the second version of the command:

\verbatim
   $ sequencer64/sequencer64 &
   $ sequencer64/sequencer64 --bus 5 &
\endverbatim

In <i>File / Options / MIDI Clock</i>, observe the MIDI inputs made available
by your system.  Our system shows:

\verbatim
   [0] 14:0 (Midi Through Port-0)
   [1] 128:0 (TiMidity port 0)
   [2] 128:0 (TiMidity port 1)
   [3] 128:0 (TiMidity port 2)
   [4] 128:0 (TiMidity port 3)
   [5] 129:0 (input)
\endverbatim

For some reason (a bug in Yoshimi?),
input "[5]" doesn't indicate that it is Yoshimi, but
it is.  Take note of that input number... that is the MIDI buss number that is
needed to drive Yoshimi.

Also make sure that of the clock settings for those busses are "Off".

<b>
The next instruction still works, but it is easier to simply pass the
option <code>--bus 5</code> to Sequencer64 when starting it up.
</b>

Now open the file <code>sequencer64/contrib/midi/b4uacuse-GM-format.midi</code>
in Sequencer64.  For all of the patterns (slots) that have lots of data in
them, right click on the pattern and select <i>Midi Bus / [5] 129:0 (input)</i>
and the desired channel number.  (Doesn't matter much, just use up the lower
channel numbers first).

Back in Yoshimi, select each Part corresponding to the channels you selected.
Make sure <i>Enabled</i> is checked for each desired channel.

Back in Sequencer64, click on each pattern you want to hear, which highlights
them in black.  Now click the play button (green triangle).  The song should
play, with each part using the "Simple Sound".  Not too bad for a bunch of sine
waves, eh?

Now we can test the application more fully.
Note that the instructions here are very light.
Detailed instructions on the usage of Sequencer64 can be found in the
following project, which contains a PDF file and the LaTeX code used to build
it:

\verbatim
   https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-doc.git
\endverbatim

Although it applies to an earlier version of the project, it still mostly holds
true for Sequencer64. 

\section user_testing_patterns Tests in the Patterns Window

The Patterns window is the inside portion of the main window, supported by the
<code> mainwid </code> class.  it contains a grid of boxes or slots, with each
slot potentially containing a pattern, sequence, or track.  Empty tracks (i.e.
tracks that contain no events, like title-only tracks) are highlighted in
yellow.

This window supports only a single variant of mouse-handling.

\subsection user_testing_patterns_buttons Button Clicks on a Pattern

A left-click on a pattern slot should cause the following to happen:

   -# The pattern will be highlighted (white on a black background).
      This won't occur until the button is released.
   -# During playback, the pattern will emit MIDI events and play its sequence.
   -# If the pattern is dragged to another slot, whether playing is in progress
      or not, releasing the button in the destination slot will move the
      pattern to that slot.

A right-click on a pattern slot should cause the following to happen:

   -# If the pattern is empty, then a pop-up menu to make a New pattern, paste
      a pattern, or make other selections will appear.
   -# If the pattern is active, then a pop-up menu to Edit the pattern or make
      other selections will appear.
   -# A second right-click, just off the menu, will dismiss the menu.

\subsection user_testing_patterns_shortcuts Patterns Window Key Shortcuts

First, note the selection of the File / Options / Keyboard / Show keys option.
The tests here should work whether or not it is selected.  The only difference
is if the keys are shown.

We got a segfault during this test, when we weren't being systematic about it.

\subsection user_testing_patterns_usr The Sequencer64 User File

To be discussed.

\section user_testing_valgrind Tests Using Valgrind

Valgrind is a very useful tool for unearthing memory issues and other issues in
an application, especially when one has the source code and can build the code
with debugging information.

One runs the application from the command line, preceding its command line with
valgrind and some of its options.

\subsection user_testing_valgrind_supp Valgrind Suppressions

One problem with valgrind is that it also uncovers errors in system libraries
that one has no control over.  These errors clutter the output, so we suppress
them using a valgrind "suppressions" file.  Here's how to create one:

\verbatim
  $ valgrind --gen-suppressions=yes --log-file=val.supp ./Sequencer64/sequencer64
  $ valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --log-file=val.supp ./Sequencer64/sequencer64
\endverbatim

As the program runs, one is asked to print a suppression.  If the error is due
to a system or third-party library, answer "Y return", and then copy-and-paste
the suppression to a file, giving it a name.  For example, we provide a file
<code>contrib/seq64.supp</code> containing suppressions of errors that annoy
us.  There are way too many "errors" in ALSA, GTK+, gtkmm, glibc, and more.

The second command collects all the suppressions.  Passing the val.supp
file through sed makes it immediately usable:

\verbatim
   $ sed -i -e /^==/g val.supp
\endverbatim

Running valgrind like this then shows mostly the errors we care about:

\verbatim
  $ valgrind --suppressions=val.supp  ./Sequencer64/sequencer64
\endverbatim

We've added some other suppression files to the <code>contrib</code> directory.
Too much!  For example:

   https://github.com/dtrebbien/GNOME.supp

However, overall this process is very painful, and we're going to eventually
do all the valgrind work on the unit-test project for Sequencer64:

   https://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq64-tests

\subsection user_testing_valgrind_full Full Valgrind Leak-Checking

Here's how to capture errors, while suppressing the system errors and while
generating a log file:

\verbatim
   $ valgrind --suppressions=contrib/seq64.supp --leak-check=full \
      --track-origins=yes --log-file=valgrind.log --show-leak-kinds=all \
      ./Sequencer64/sequencer64
\endverbatim

The errors can be also be re-routed to a log-file via the
"2> valgrind.log" shell redirection.

Another idea is to precede the valgrind command with the following construct:

\verbatim
   $ G_SLICE=debug-blocks valgrind ...
\endverbatim

G_SLICE=debug-blocks will turn off gtk's advanced memory management to allow
valgrind to show correct results.  This results in an amazing plethora or
invalid read and invalid write errors in GNOME-related libraries.
Sheesh!

And don't forget about Valgrind's "massif" memory-tracking tool!
(More to come!)

\subsubsection user_testing_valgrind_basic Leak-Checking Basic Operation

For the first pass, just run Sequencer64, then immediately exit.
Then scan the log file to see if any "errors" can be pinpointed to the
application and library code.

Don't forget to run the same scenario without valgrind, in a console window, to
see if any of our own debug/problem output occurs.

In any case, leakage tagged as "still reachable" isn't as bad as leakage tagged
as "definitely lost" or "indirectly lost".

But good luck finding a Sequencer64 bug buried in the chaff of 3rd-party
valgrind reports, even with some suppressions enabled.  Apparently a lot of
them have to do with data structures that are intended to last the full life of
the application.

One can make the search a little easier by searching for the "seq64" namespace
in the valgrind log.

\section user_testing_cases Specific Fault Debugging

This section goes through specific debugging cases we encountered.
They should be part of the regular testing of Sequencer64.

\section user_testing_case_snipped Snipping of a MIDI file.

In order to have a test file for the <i> seq64-tests </i> project, we
loaded up the <code>b4uacuse-GM-format.midi</code> file, removed all but
four of the tracks, and saved it as <code>b4uacuse-snipped.midi</code>.
Loading this file into Sequencer64 caused the following:

\verbatim
   $ ./Sequencer64/sequencer64 
[Reading user configuration /home/ahlstrom/.config/sequencer64/sequencer64.usr]
[Reading rc configuration /home/ahlstrom/.config/sequencer64/sequencer64.rc]
get_sequence(): m_seqs[4] not null
Segmentation fault
\endverbatim

First step, fire up a debugger and see what happened.  We use <i> cgdb </i>, a
text-based front-end for gdb with a "vi" feel.

\verbatim
   $ cgdb ./Sequencer64/sequencer64 
\endverbatim

Just hit "r", do <i> File / Open </i>, navigate to
<code>b4uacuse-snipped.midi</code>, select it, and watch what happens.

The "bt" (backtrace) command shows a pretty large stack, 52 items.
Page up to the top of the stack, and select frame 1 ("fr 1").
This shows a mutex at a very low address, 0x650!  Frame 2 shows we are in the
automutex constructor, calling lock() on that same badly-located mutex.
Frame 3 is in sequence::event_count(), same bad mutex, and the m_events member
is at address 0x0.  Obviously, we're dealing with an unallocated sequence.

Frame 4 is in mainwid::draw_sequence_on_pixmap(), just after we've
retrieved the next sequence via perform::get_sequence(4).  But that
would be the fifth sequence (the sequence numbers start at 0), and we snipped
all but 4 from the file before we saved it.

So, one thing we need to do is <i> check </i> the value returned by
get_sequence() before we try to use it.  The other thing to do is figure out
how we got to the fifth sequence, and fix that code as well.
Using the command "p perf().sequence_count()", we verify that there are indeed
only 4 sequences allocated.

Frame 5 is in mainwid::draw_sequences_on_pixmap().  That function
tries to load all sequences on the current screen-set, from 0 to 31,
without checking to see how many their actually are.  Inefficient and
dangerous.

Frame 6 is in mainwid::reset().  We could pass perf().sequence_count() here
for checking, or get it in mainwid::draw_sequences_on_pixmap().

Before we fix this issue, we need to load a file that works, to see why it does
not fail for most files.  We will put a breakpoint at the top
mainwid::draw_sequences_on_pixmap().

We hit the breakpoint before even loading a file, with a sequence_count() of 0.
The call to valid_sequence(0) passes the test.  We may want to make
valid_sequence() take the sequence_count() into account.  But the call to
perf().is_active(0) prevents anything bad from happening at startup time.

Once we load a good file, the sequence_count() is 14 in
mainwid::draw_sequences_on_pixmap().  We turn on the display of "offset" using
the command "display offset", and "c" (for "continue") until offset = 14, which
means we are beyond that last sequence.  That bad access is prevented
by perf().is_active(14).

So the fundamental problem is that perf().is_active(4) is not protecting the
access when we load the "bad file".  We need to find and fix that issue before
papering over the problem with better access checks.

Start again, putting a breakpoint in the call to "new sequence(m_ppqn)" in
midifile.  This call sets up some members and clears the list of 256 playing
notes.  Add another breakpoint at "a_perf.add_sequence()" to see what's
happening there.

What we find is that the first two tracks have proper sequence numbers as read
from the MIDI file, 0 and 1.  But the third one preserves the number from the
old file, 4.  We have a disjunction between the track number and the sequence
number, a conceptual problem.  We can leave it as is, and beef up the
error-checking, or replace the sequence number with the track number
when loading the file.  What to do?

   -  Make sure that the is-active flag for all sequences is "false",
      that the pointers are always null, and make sure to test both of these
      items (depending on context) before doing anything with the sequence.
   -  Convert the sequence number to the track number upon saving the MIDI
      file, or upon reading the MIDI file, and use that number when adding
      the sequence to the perform object.  This might affect some
      seq24/sequencer64 functionality, however.  It's big move.

We need information on reading and importing.

First, if we look at a file that we created long ago by importing
<code>b4uacuse.mid</code>, <code>b4uacuse-GM-format.midi</code>, it
has its fourteen sequence numbers identical to their track numbers.
No problem.

Second, if we just read <code>b4uacuse.mid</code>, a non-seq24-created
MIDI file, we see that each of its tracks have no sequence number -- they are
all zero.  The perform::add_sequence() simple iterates from the beginning of
m_seqs[] until it finds an inactive m_seqs[i], and uses that element to hold
the sequence pointer.

But now it also segfaults!  Let's fix  all the non-checked get_sequence() calls
right away, it is too big an issue to ignore.

In the end, we have to be aware that a screen-set can have blank (null) slots
interspersed amongst the active slots.
