# Sequencer64 0.9.9.9 (and above) user configuration file
#
# 2015-11-21: STILL IN PROGRESS!!!!
#
# Created by reading taking the basic "user" configuration file example
# and editing as per the following settings on my system:
#
#    Port    Client name                      Port name
#
#    14:0    Midi Through                     Midi Through Port-0
#   128:0    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 0
#   128:1    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 1
#   128:2    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 2
#   128:3    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 3
#   129:0    (yoshimi) input                  Yoshimi port 0
#
# Not sure if it is useful to include the thru port, but okay.
# Also, I am assuming the default timidity setup is GM-compliant.
# Finally, there's a lot that can be set up with Yoshimi, even ignoring
# the changes that can be wrought by loading a different *.xmz file
# into Yoshimi.
#
# In the following MIDI buss definitions, channels are counted
# from 0 to 15, not 1 to 16.  Instruments unspecified are set to
# -1 (SEQ64_GM_INSTRUMENT_FLAG) and are GM (General MIDI).

#   ======== Sequencer64-Specific Variables Section ========

[user-interface-settings]

# These settings specify the soon-to-be-modifiable configuration
# of some of the Sequencer64 user-interface elements.

# Specifies the style of the main-window grid of patterns.
#
# 0 = Normal style, matches the GTK theme, has brackets.
# 1 = White grid boxes that have brackets.
# 2 = Black grid boxes (no brackets).

2       # grid_style

# Specifies box style of an empty slot in the main-window grid.
#
# 0  = Draw a one-pixel box outline around the pattern slot.
# 1  = Draw brackets on the sides of the pattern slot.
# 2 to 30 = Make the brackets thicker and thicker.
# -1 = Same as 0, draw a box outline one-pixel thick.
# -2 to -30 = Draw a box outline, thicker and thicker.

2       # grid_brackets

# Specifies the number of rows in the main window.
# At present, only a value of 4 is supportable.
# In the future, we hope to support an alternate value of 8.

4       # mainwnd_rows

# Specifies the number of columns in the main window.
# At present, only a value of 8 is supportable.

8       # mainwnd_cols

# Specifies the maximum number of sets, which defaults to 1024.
# It is currently never necessary to change this value.

32      # max_sets

# Specifies the border width in the main window.

0      # mainwid_border

# Specifies the border spacing in the main window.

2      # mainwid_spacing

# Specifies some quantity, it is not known what it means.

0      # control_height

# Specifies the initial zoom for the piano rolls.  Ranges from 1.
# to 32, and defaults to 2 unless changed here.

2      # zoom

# Specifies if the key, scale, and background sequence are to be
# applied to all sequences, or to individual sequences.  The
# behavior of Seq24 was to apply them to all sequences.  But
# Sequencer64 takes it further by applying it immediately, and
# by saving to the end of the MIDI file.  Note that these three
# values are stored in the MIDI file, not this configuration file.
# Also note that reading MIDI files not created with this feature
# will pick up this feature if active, and the file gets saved.
# It is contagious.
#
# 0 = Allow each sequence to have its own key/scale/background.
#     Settings are saved with each sequence.
# 1 = Apply these settings globally (similar to seq24).
#     Settings are saved in the global final section of the file..

1      # global_seq_feature

# Specifies if the old, console-style font, or the new anti-
# aliased font, is to be used as the font throughout the GUI.
# In legacy mode, the old font is the default.
#
# 0 = Use the old-style font.
# 1 = Use the new-style font.

1      # use_new_font

[user-midi-settings]

# These settings specify MIDI-specific value that might be
# better off as variables, rather than constants.

# Specifies parts-per-quarter note to use, if the MIDI file.
# does not override it.  Default is 192, but we'd like to go
# higher than that.  BEWARE:  STILL GETTING IT TO WORK!

192       # midi_ppqn

# Specifies the default beats per measure, or beats per bar.
# The default value is 4.

4       # midi_beats_per_measure/bar

# Specifies the default beats per minute.  The default value
# is 120, and the legal range is 20 to 500.

120       # midi_beats_per_minute

# Specifies the default beat width. The default value is 4.

4       # midi_beat_width

# Specifies the buss-number override. The default value is -1,
# which means that there is no buss override.  If a value
# from 0 to 31 is given, then that buss value overrides all
# buss values specified in all sequences/patterns.
# Change this value from -1 only if you want to use a single
# output buss, either for testing or convenience.  And don't
# save the MIDI afterwards, unless you really want to change
# all of its buss values.
