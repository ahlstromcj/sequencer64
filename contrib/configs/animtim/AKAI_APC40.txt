Animtim uses this map file on both Ardour and Seq64.

Midi bindings for APC40 on seq64:

   -  Copy sequencer64.rc to ~/.config/sequencer64/

   -  The 4 first lines of "Clip launch": launch respective clips in current
      set

   -  The 5th line of "Clip launch" trigger mute groups with patterns from 01
      up to 07 on the respective 7 first buttons (mute groups from keys shift +
      1 to 7)

   -  The 4 first buttons of "Scene launch" column launch full-line mute groups
      (from keys shift + 8 i k ;)

   -  The 5th "Scene launch" button activates the Snapshot mode. The button on
      its left restores the snapshot (the bottom-right button of "Clip
      launch").

   -  The "Clip stop" buttons stop the respective columns

   -  "Bank Select" up for next set, down for previous set

   -  "Stop all clips" activates the Replace mode

   -  "Shift" activates the Keep-Queue mode. (Note: There's a bug when using
      "off" control on queue mode, which makes mute-group shortcuts broken, so
      people should use Ctrl_right on keyboard to disable keep queue.)

   -  "Nudge-" reduces bpm, "Nudge+" increases it

Side notes:

   -  You can combine Snapshot and Replace (first press snapshot, then replace,
      then the new patterns, then restore)

   -  Replace doesn't work with queue
