In a github fork, keep the master branch clean (no changes pending).
Then you can create a branch from your master. Each time you want to
commit a bug or a feature, create a branch for it, which is a copy of your
master branch.

When you do a pull request on a branch, you can continue to work on another
branch and make another pull request on this other branch.

Create the branch on your local machine and switch to it:

    $ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

When the branch is ready, push the branch to github:

    $ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

Better, to make sure git pull will work, set an upstream branch:

    $ git push -u origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to first
checkout the branch.

Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been
updated:

    $ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

Others can track your branch in this manner to simplify the git push
command:

    $ git checkout --track -b your_branch origin/your_branch
    $ git commit ...
    $ git push

Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from
develop you need to do:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop

If you set up an upstream branch, then this will suffice:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge develop

Delete a branch on your local filesystem, use -d or -D (to force):

    $ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]

Delete the branch on github:

    $ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]

Caching your credentials (be careful!):

    $ git config credential.helper store

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
