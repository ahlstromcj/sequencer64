Why is yoshimi:midi in not an output????

   Commenting out the perform's swap() call changed nothing!!!!!

Connect issues with JACK, jack-keyboard, yoshimi, and seq64:

   midibus jack-keyboard:midi_in (is input port):

midibus::api_connect() has null m_rt_midi pointer.  Fixed as a
configuration-related issue.

Clicking on jack-keyboard:midi_out in the MIDI Input tab is meant to
connect the output of the jack-keyboard application to seq64's
selected MIDI input port.

mmbus::set_input(0, true)

m_inbus_array[0].m_bus is  jack-keyboard:midi_out

   Back to the beginning:

At startup, we register "jack-keyboard midi_out".
When we click ...., we try to register it again!  Why
does it get registered at startup???  It is set to off
in the "rc" configuration!

jack-keyboard:midi_out is a Readable Client/Output port
jack-keyboard:midi_in is a Writable Client/Input port

   register_port: JACK error registering port system midi_capture_1

Seq64 shows an output for yoshimi:midi in, but there is no
"seq64:yoshimi midi in" shown in the Readable/Output tab.

BEEF UP THE OUTPUT.

Oh, I just noticed this timing issue is highly depending on jack buffer size.
I initially had it set to 1024 (and 3 periods). Issue is subtle but can be
heard.  Then I tested with 256, and couldn't really hear the issue (but then I
have occasional xruns, very few but still).  Then I tested with 2048, and the
issue gets really worse, really easy to hear it.

Subject: Re: [ahlstromcj/sequencer64] Any mechanism for live tempo control? (#86) 

I see what he means: for now, when using jack transport, the bpm seems to be
locked in seq64 while playing. That is both true as master and as slave.For now
my workaround is to use "old school" sync with midi clock, and not use jack
transport.
																	 
Note that in my case, as I want to sync seq64 with ardour5 and the latter
doesn't seem to support getting external tempo, so I define/change the tempo in
ardour and send its midi clock to seq64.. but that is more an issue from the
ardour side.

Subject: Re: [ahlstromcj/sequencer64] Any mechanism for live tempo control? (#86) 

I started quickly testing the wip branch, changing bpm seems to work now with
jack transport, at least correctly as slave.  When using seq64 as jack
transport master, changing bpm does some weird time-position shift, both when
using numeric input or the tap bpm button.  And also, when using it like this
with ardour, ardour does some weird stop/play at every bpm change from seq64.

. . .

after testing again launching only seq64 as transport master and carla as
plugin host, changing bpm in seq64 doesn't make weird time-position shift, so
it was probably a kind of transport-position conflict from launching ardour
before.

Subject: [ahlstromcj/sequencer64] [Jack Transport] Seq64 doesn't reposition jack
        transport (#88)

Jack transport repositioning function is only called when seq64 is set as
transport master, this doesn't conform to common usage : clients can
relocate, the transport master's only privilegied controls are related to 
bpm and cycles lengths. Hydrogen's handling of jack transport is a good
example we could follow, what do you think ?

. . .

     I still thinking that "JACK slaves" should not change tempo;

I agree, it's the transport's position that's supposed to be changeable by
slaves.


http://www.jackaudio.org/files/docs/html/transport-design.html

     Transport Control
     The JACK engine itself manages stopping and starting of the transport.
     Any client can make transport control requests at any time.

     Repositioning
     These request a new transport position. They can be called at any time
     by any client. Even the timebase master must use them

. . .

Also, when testing seq64's jack related things, note that there is a bug
that currently prevents any jack-related change to actually work when done
from the gui, you have to relaunch the app...
