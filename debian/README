Sequencer64 Debian Instructions

There's a concise, recent, and fairly complete guide to creating a "deb"
package in the Debian package called "maint-guide", which stores different
versions of the "Debian New Maintainers' Guide" in
/usr/share/doc/maint-guide.

However, since the rules file was already provided by the Debian maintainer
of seq24, the process of creating a "deb" file is very simple.

1. Make sure the command console's current directory is the top directory
   of the project.

2. Run the following command (it can be a useful error check):

   $ debian/rules clean

3. Run the following command:

   $ fakeroot debian/rules/binary

   In the directory just above the top directory of the project, you will
   find:   sequencer64_0.9.9-1_amd64.deb

4. Run the following command again to get rid of all the build products:

   $ debian/rules clean
