/**
 *  Provides a way to still get the benefits of assert() output in release
 *  mode, without aborting the application.
 *
 * \todo
 *      This can slow down client code slightly, and it would be good to
 *      reduce the impact.
 *
 * \param ptr
 *      Provides the pointer to be tested.
 *
 * \param context
 *      Provides context for the message.  Usually the __func__ macro is
 *      the best option for this parameter.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns true in release mode, if the pointer was not null.  In
 *      debug mode, will always return true, but the assert() will abort
 *      the application anyway.
