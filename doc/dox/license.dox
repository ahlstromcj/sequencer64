\section gpl_license_text License Terms for the This Project.

   Wherever the tag $XPC_SUITE_GPL_LICENSE$ appears, or wherever reference
   to the GPL licensing scheme (any version) is mentioned, substitute the
   appropriate license text, depending on whether the project is a library,
   application, documentation, or server software.  We're not going to
   include paragraphs of licensing information in every module; you are
   responsible for coming here to read the licensing information.
   
   These licenses apply to each sub-project and file artifact in the
   project with which this license description was packaged.

   Wherever the term <b>XPC</b> is encountered in this project, it
   refers to my projects, which go beyond the package that contains this
   document.

\section gpl_license_application XPC Application License

   The <b>XPC</b> application license is either the <b>GNU GPLv2</b>.
   or the <b>GNU GPLv3</b>.  Generally, projects that originate with me use
   the latter language, while projects I have extended may specify the
   former license.
