Construction of "Where's Prince Brilliant" for ZynAddSubFx/Yoshimi

This file describes the importing of one of my old Cakewalk transcriptions, a
rendering of "Where's Prince Brilliant?" from (unreliable) memory.

Here's the original:

(I think they "cheated" with the percussion... live drums.  But that was 1970.)

Obviously, my version is way off and raggy, due to my very weak musical
skills and not-so-good musical memory.  But I was able to use it to learn
how to work with the Seq24 MIDI editor and the Yoshimi/ZynAddSubFx software
synthesizer.  Although Seq24 is geared towards creating patterns, it works
pretty well for full tracks as well.

All source files are located in the Seq24/WPB directory.

Imported the original (created for Sound Blaster Wave and FM,
plus MT-32) *.mid file into Seq24.  Reduced it to 8 voices:

   1. Lead
   2. Base
   3. Strings
   4. Alarum
   5. Lead Alternate
   6. Harpsichord
   7. Accompaniment
   8. Drum kit

Picked a pre-existing drum kit for Yoshimi, the original Drums_Kit1.
Remapped the MIDI tracks to this kit:

Transpose   MIDI Note, Name            ZynAddSubFX Note, Name

    -8      44, Bass Drum 1            36, Bass Drum 2
     0      50, Tom Mid 1              50, Tom
   -15      56, Shaker / Brush         41, Tom
    +7      41, Tom Low 1              48, Tom
     0      38, Snared Gated           38, Snare Drum 1
   -15      57, Hi Hat Closed          42, Hit Hat (closed)
   -19      54, Hand Clap              35, Bass Drum 1
   -15      59, Hi Hat Open            44, Hit Hat (pedal)
            
Actually, we changed the key range of "Tom" from 41-50 to 41-60 to
have access to more electronic toms at the high end.

Saved instruments to wpb_yoshimi_params.xmz
Modified Home Piano to be softer in volume.

Yoshimi parts:

   1. Ch 10.  Drums/Drums Kit (0001-Drums_Kit1b.xiz)
   2. Ch  6.  Bells/Music Box (0002-Music_Box.xiz)
   3. Ch  7.  Strings/Saw Strings 4 (0004-Saw Strings 4.xiz)
   4. Ch  9.  Bass/Electric Bass (0041-Electric_Bass.xiz)
   5. Ch  8.  Harpsichord Piano/Warm Piano (0139-Home Piano.xiz)
   6. Ch  3.  Pad/Resonance Pad 2 (0009-Resonance Pad2.xiz)
   7. Ch  2.  Pad/Resonance Pad 2 (0009-Resonance Pad2.xiz)
   8. Ch  5.  Brass/errrrr (?)
   9. Ch  4.  C_Ahlstrom/Sub Pseudo Steel Drums

Channel 9 ("Alarum") is muted, doesn't really add anything good.

Seq24 settings:

   [1] seq24 1 Channel 10

To set up and play the tune (using ALSA):

   1. Make sure that the seq24 or sequencer24 config ("rc") files
      specify 0 for manual-alsa-ports, and do not set up any MIDI clocks.

   2. yoshimi -a -A -l wpb_yoshimi_params.xmz

   3. sequencer24 wpb_yoshimi.midi &

   4. File / Options / MIDI Clock:  Verify which MIDI buss Yoshimi is
      on.  In our case, it is on buss 5 (buss 0 is Midi Through, and 1
      through 4 are ports created by TiMidity).  There are probably better
      ways to do this, but right click on each pattern to select buss 5 and
      the channel shown after the dash in the lower left corner of each
      pattern.  Probably best to save this to a new file, just in case.

   5. Open the Song Editor of sequencer24.  Click the red play arrow.
